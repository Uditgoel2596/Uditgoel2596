MIS Analyst turned Data Analyst | Unlocking Insights with Data
âœ¦ With 1+ year of experience as an MIS Analyst, I've developed a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization. Recently, I've enhanced my skills through intensive courses, mastering tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel.

Tech Skills:
âœ¦ Python: Data manipulation, analysis, scripting
âœ¦ SQL: Database querying, data extraction
âœ¦ Power BI: Interactive visualizations, business intelligence
âœ¦ Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel
âœ¦ Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, advanced analytics
